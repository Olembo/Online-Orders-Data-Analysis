## Project Overview

This repository explores a personal dataset of online orders placed by a two person household between 2018 and 2025. The goal is to:

- Understand spending trends over time  
- Measure savings from discounts and promotions  
- Compare shopping behavior between household members  
- Identify favorite categories and platforms  
- Assess delivery performance and costs  

All insights are tied to real-life events (e.g., moves, life milestones, the pandemic).

## Dataset

The cleaned CSV contains the following columns:
order_id, purchase_date, platform, items_name, category,
quantity, unit_price, shipping_cost, discount_amount,
total_price, payment_method, delivery_date, shipping_address,
city, country, return/refund, order_by,
delivery_days, discount_used, order_month, order_year,
order_month_year, is_returned


**Data sources:** personal online order history export (CSV) covering purchases from 2018 to 2025. All data is anonymized.
